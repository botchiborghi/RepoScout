Type: gist (no repo)

## What it is
A Claude skill to generate polished HTML reports from compact JSON specs (ECharts‑based).

## Hands‑on notes
- ✅ Clear instructions and sample report link.
- ⚠️ Not a repo (no tests, no CI). Validation is doc‑level only.
- 🔧 Useful for fast reporting, not for multi‑agent orchestration.

## How we tried it
- Reviewed the raw gist content + sample report flow.
- If moved into a repo, we can run demo scripts and validate rendering.

## How we'd use it
- Quick ad‑hoc analysis summaries for DS/AI work.
- Fits in reporting/insight delivery, not core agent infrastructure.
